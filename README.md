html-macros
===========

An HTML to HTML compiler. The idea is to do some things such as I18N, includes, static logic at compile time and 
let javascript focus on runtime behaviour.

Features:

 * I18N messages
 * Include documents within other documents.
 * Inlining CSS
 * Other compile time stuff...
 * 
 
Early work in progress!
